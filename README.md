# Thin_Walls_UCP
Very thin walls, but not too thin, from old Apertures wall thinning experiments "If a human can lose weight, then why not a wall!"

A UCP I made for myself for a very specific purpose. Other UCPs didn't have what I needed so I just made it myself, and what the heck, why not release it for other people to try too. A very thin wall that is thinner than typical walls, but not as thin as a texture, something in the middle. Apologies in advance for each texture being a different item, but I didn't know how to get instances to work so that was the best I could do. It's not perfect, but it works for me, and I hope you can get something good out of it too!

Just copy and paste the .bee file into the "packages" folder in BEEMod and you should be good
